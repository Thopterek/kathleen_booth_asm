# Idea is to understand basics like this:

## and then deepen the knowledge

I am making and saving those sources for myself.

I tried to also make it approachable, so hopefully you can also benefit from it.
 
### Thats why the code you can see in the repo is written like the one below.

<img width="525" alt="Snapshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12cf27d4-60c3-49c3-b217-92d791cbc214" />

There is much more to the comments related to the subject.

I also wanted to digitalize some of my notes that I made.

### That's why you can find things like this in the handwritten folder:

<img width="760" alt="hier" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89523442-f08f-485f-9856-e6161a61fd24" />

#### which is a mix of notes named per topic:

- some mention from where they come from to add context

- others are named per what they are about

#### Another part are important resources

Like this amazing [linux syscall table](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/).

Or way to learn interactive through [pwn college](https://pwn.college/computing-101/).

Same for some good write up about [NASM from LMU](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/).

Plus some proper [NASM documentations](https://www.nasm.us/xdoc/2.16.03/nasmdoc.pdf).

MIT Performance engineering on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt7a5BOztuM&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63VIBQVWguXxZZi0566y7Wf&index=5).

Flat assembeler documentation for CPP preference style [manual](https://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual).

And instruction reference for x86/amd64 as a group of [IS](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/).

#### If you have more great resources I would love to add them

Thank you for your time and hopefully it will also help you
